Tores Console

This is a serial application for the arduino.

It has "dos key".
Write some commands and use up and down keys in the command box.

In combination with the tores arduino scetch it can be used to
down and upload dump file from i2c connected EEproms. Actually
this was the reason for this app to reset my toner chip.

Tores stands for Toner reset :-)
